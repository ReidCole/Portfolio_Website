        <p>
          I&apos;ve been into technology, especially software, ever since I was a little kid. I
          remember trying to jailbreak several devices of mine back then just because I thought it
          was so cool that you could customize devices beyond what was originally intended. I also
          spent much of my time using sites like YouTube and Facebook, and I was always curious
          about how they worked behind the scenes. When it came time for me to choose a career path,
          coding seemed only natural for me, since it follows that curiosity for software I&apos;ve
          always had. Now we are here, where I can create my own software through code. I get to
          make cool web apps that can be useful tools in solving problems. If I ever need somewhere
          to write notes and save them in the cloud, I can make it. If my friends ever want a
          personalized site for us to chat together, I can make it. If you want a website, I can
          make it. üò∏‚úåÔ∏è
